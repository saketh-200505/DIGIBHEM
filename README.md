ðŸ”’ Password Strength Checker && Caesar Cipher && Pixel Encoding

This Python project integrates three key components:
- Password Strength Checker: Validates passwords based on complexity.
- Caesar Cipher Encryption: Performs basic encryption on passwords using a character shift.
- Pixel-Level Image Encoding: Embeds encrypted passwords into images at the RGB pixel level.
  
âœ¨ Features

- Checks password strength (length, digit, special char, uppercase, lowercase).
- Applies Caesar cipher with customizable shift.
- Hides encrypted password in image pixels using direct pixel value manipulation.
- Recovers embedded data and decrypts it back to original password.
  
ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (pip install pillow)
